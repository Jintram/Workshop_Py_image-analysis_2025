    "There exist many good image analysis tutorials. I wrote this one because it's easier to teach my own texts, and it aims to follow the *Carpentries* style code-along.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, there are chunks of code that are intended to be typed by the instructor, to be projected on a large screen. Workshop participants should type along, in order to get \"hands on\" experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there are exercise parts, which participants can do on their own, supervised by the instructor. Some parts are notebooks on which you can work completely on your own.\n"
